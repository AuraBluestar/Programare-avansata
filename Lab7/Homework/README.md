# Homework 
- Implement the logic of the game and determine who the winner is at the end of the game.
- The players will try to make their sequences using a simple heuristic.
- Make sure that players wait their turns, using a wait-notify approach.
- Implement a timekeeper thread that runs concurrently with the player threads, as a daemon. This thread will display the running time of the game and it will stop the game if it exceeds a certain time limit.
