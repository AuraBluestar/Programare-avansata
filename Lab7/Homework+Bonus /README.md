# Homework 
- Implement the logic of the game and determine who the winner is at the end of the game.
- The players will try to make their sequences using a simple heuristic.
- Make sure that players wait their turns, using a wait-notify approach.
- Implement a timekeeper thread that runs concurrently with the player threads, as a daemon. This thread will display the running time of the game and it will stop the game if it exceeds a certain time limit.

# Bonus(did)
- Implement a "smart" player. This should try to create the optimum sequence using its tiles, in some special cases.

# Bonus(didn't)
- Verify if the graph satisfies the Ore's condition and implement, using Graph4J API, a polynomial time algorithm for determining a hamiltonian cycle in graphs that meet Ore's condition.
