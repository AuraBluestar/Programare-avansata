* Create classes that describe the problem and its solution.
* Override the equals method from the Object class for the Depot, Vehicle, Client classes. The problem should not allow adding the same depot, vehicle or client twice.

* Implement the method getVehicles in the Problem class, returning an array of all the vehicles, from all depots.
